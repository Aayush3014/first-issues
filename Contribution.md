# Contribution Guidelines

You can contribute to this repository by either solving an issue or suggesting improvements/changes in the code.

The following guidelines should be followed while sending Pull request:

- If you feel like that you
     have created a legitimate bug fix or contribution, make sure to search
     previously submitted pull requests (if any) before making a new one, to
     avoid redundancy. If you still feel like your contribution is more
     relevant, then please specify appropriately.
- Make sure your contribution
     is useful and relevant before submitting. That implies it having quality
     content and with every item having a good succinct description.
- Make an individual pull
     request for each suggestion.
- Use the following
     format: - [Repository Name](link-to-repository)
     _(beginner-friendly-label-in-the-repository)_ &lt;desc&gt; Description
- Link additions should be added
     to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or
     improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Be careful with your
     spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor truncates
     trailing whitespaces from both ends.
- The pull request and commit
     should have a meaningful title.
- Make sure to give a
     description about your pull request, to make the task of merge easier.
- If label does not clearly
     state its "beginner friendly" purpose, please make sure to
     confirm with maintainer that it is used for such issues. Please include
     the link to where maintainer confirms it in the PR. See examples below:
    - Repository called
      "HornsAndHoovesJs" has label good-first-contribution. This PR does not need to be confirmed with
      the maintainer and can be merged straight away.
    - Repository called
      "bicycle-wheels-php" has label easy.
      This PR must be confirmed with the maintainer of
      "bicycle-wheels-php". Link to the issue where maintainer
      confirms that label easy is used in the
      repository for beginner-friendly tasks has to be provided in the PR
      description.

- Maintainer confirmation is
     also required in case repository has more than one beginner-friendly-like
     label (e.g. low-hanging-fruit and up-for-grabs).
- Contributed repository must
     be maintained, have active community to be able to help newcomers and have
     issues with appropriate label.
- Links must be pointing
     directly to the repository, no tracking links allowed. This list is not
     for advertising purposes.

Thank you for your contributions in advance!
